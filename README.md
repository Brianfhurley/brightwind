The brightwind library aims to empower wind resource analysts and establish a common industry standard toolset.

Brightwindâ€™s open source python library provides wind analysts with easy to use tools for working with
meteorological data. It supports loading of meteorological data, averaging, filtering, plotting, correlations, shear analysis,
long term adjustments, etc. The library can export a resulting long term adjusted tab file to be used in
other software. The code for these tools is fully open and transparent to enable community validation and bring the industry forward.
